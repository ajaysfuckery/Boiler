# Boiler
A tool used for creating boilerplate code for HTML and C files.
It saves a lot of time when learning or developing Webpages with basic HTML and it can create boilerplate code for C programs.
This tool can be used on any OS with C (MinGW) installed.

Requirements~

Windows
C (MinGW)
Bloodshed Dev-cpp

Linux
gcc

Instructions~<br/>

<b><i>C Windows</i></b>

To use the C version on windows you need to have MinGW installed. Look for a video on youtube showing the install process of it.

To compile the C source file you can use Bloodshed dev-cpp.
Just open the file in bloodshed and hit F11 to compile and run it XD

<b><i>Linux</i></b>

Install the gcc package using your package manager

Compile the C source code using: gcc boiler.c -o boiler

Execute the new boiler file by typing: ./boiler


<i>And now the codes come out~</i>


<b>Enjoy~</b>
